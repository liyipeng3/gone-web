This is a blog built with TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

I write it for me, but if you find it useful, that's great, if you can help me improve it, that's even better.

## Features

- Modern user interface design
- Responsive layout for various devices
- Blog post creation, editing, and management
- User comment system
- Personal dashboard
- Search functionality
- Accessibility support

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying files in the `app` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
